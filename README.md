# NRUHSE-AdvancedMachineLearning
These are a series of 7 courses on advanced machine learning techniques by the National Research University Higher School of Economics. I have included python jupyter notebook assignments for future use and reference.

*** Course 5 folder note: 5 notebooks in total. Additional files (data, helper .py files, example images, etc.) also available offline. The size of these files did not really warrant an attempt to push everything onto this repo.
